# Gameplay/Design

- Ammo management
- Market (repairs, upgrades, and ammo)
- Health system for the cannon, replenishing of ammo
- randomly generated targets
- minigame for locating targets precisely (similar maybe to breach protocols in cp2077)
- cycles (increase after every meaningful command) to introduce a bit of time management.
